## About me

I am a fourth year engineering physics at UBC interested in researching reinforcement learning and mathematics, all aimed towards designing intelligent systems. 

Before entering university, I focused on creating a strong foundation of math fundamentals, including taking honors courses as well as self-studying various textbooks (how to prove it, real analysis, linear algebra done right). Recently I became interested in reinforcement learning leading me to read introduction to reinforcement learning by Sutton and Barto. This summer I studied probability theory, [information theory](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCiZc0n6COY&list=PLruBu5BI5n4aFpG32iMbdWoRVAA-Vcso6&ab_channel=JakobFoerster), and [heirarchical reinforcement learning](https://github.com/Jinjiarui/hrl-papers).

In 2023 I interned at [de Boer Labs](https://deboer.bme.ubc.ca/) on model interpretability. There were models trained to predict the expressiveness of DNA strands, however, we were curious about the motifs that the model used to predict this. My job focused on creating synthetic then testing interpretability tools on that data. Additionally, I implemented a mathematical model of motif cooperativity and competition into the synthetic data and vectorized the method to be run on GPUs.

My most recent project involved implementing a soft actor critic algorithm in pytorch for a project course (under ENPH353_Competiton repository). I learnt a lot in that project about the differences between doing research in the theory of RL and practical application of RL. This included learning how to (and how impossible it is to) debug RL software, hardware and memory limitations, as well as commonly used systems such as ROS and gazebo.
