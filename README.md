I’m a fifth-year Engineering Physics student at UBC with interests in robotics, reinforcement learning, and closing the sim-to-real gap.

I enjoy working across the full stack: electronics, mechanical design, firmware, computer vision, simulation, control systems, and RL. My most significant project so far has been my capstone, where an RL agent, deployed on physical hardware, plays air hockey against a human (see Air-Hockey-Sim repo). I found this project especially interesting because it required deep understanding of every subsystem, and the combination of high speed and high precision made sim-to-real extremely challenging. Every millisecond in the stack had to be modeled then implemented in simulation, and the feed-forward controller needed to reliably reproduce simulated trajectories on the physical robot.

Another notable project is ENPH353_Competition (see repo), where I implemented the SAC algorithm in PyTorch and trained a vision-based agent to minimize lap time on a simulated racetrack. This project taught me a lot about the gap between RL theory and practice, from the “impossible to debug” nature of RL, to dealing with hardware and memory constraints, to working with tools like ROS and Gazebo.
