I'm a fifth-year Engineering Physics student at UBC with interests in robotics, reinforcement learning, and closing the sim-to-real gap.

I enjoy working across the full stack: electronics, mechanical design, firmware, computer vision, simulation, control systems, and RL. My most significant project so far has been my capstone, where an RL agent, deployed on physical hardware, plays air hockey against a human (see Air-Hockey-Sim repo). What drew me to this project was the unique challenge of combining high-speed operation with precision control, which necessitated a deep understanding of each subsystem and made bridging the sim-to-real gap particularly demanding. Every millisecond in the control stack had to be modeled and implemented in simulation, and the feed-forward controller needed to reliably reproduce simulated trajectories on the physical robot.

Another notable project is the ENPH353_Competition (see repo), where I trained a vision-based agent to minimize lap time on a simulated racetrack by implementing the SAC algorithm in PyTorch. This project taught me a lot about the gap between RL theory and practice, from the "impossible to debug" nature of RL to dealing with hardware and memory constraints and working with tools like ROS and Gazebo.

I'm drawn to projects that require both theoretical depth and practical problem-solving, especially those at the intersection of learning-based methods and real-world systems. Feel free to explore my repositories, and don't hesitate to reach out if you'd like to discuss robotics, RL, or any of my projects!
