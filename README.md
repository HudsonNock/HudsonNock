## About me

I am a fourth year engineering physics at UBC interested in researching reinforcement learning and mathematics, all aimed towards designing intelligent systems. 

Beginning university, I focused on creating a strong foundation of math fundamentals, including taking honors courses as well as self-studying various textbooks (how to prove it, real analysis, linear algebra done right). Recently I became interested in reinforcement learning leading me to read introduction to reinforcement learning by Sutton and Barto. This summer I studied probability theory, [information theory](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCiZc0n6COY&list=PLruBu5BI5n4aFpG32iMbdWoRVAA-Vcso6&ab_channel=JakobFoerster), and [heirarchical reinforcement learning](https://github.com/Jinjiarui/hrl-papers).

In 2023 I interned at [de Boer Labs](https://deboer.bme.ubc.ca/) on model interpretability. Models were trained to predict the expressiveness of DNA strands, however, we were curious about the motifs that the model used to predict this. My job focused on creating synthetic data then testing interpretability tools on that data. Additionally, I implemented a mathematical model of motif cooperativity and competition into the synthetic data and vectorized the method to be run on GPUs.

One of my recent project involved implementing a soft actor critic algorithm in pytorch for a project course (under ENPH353_Competiton repo). I learnt a lot in that project about the differences between doing research in the theory of RL and practical application of RL. This included learning how to (and how impossible it is to) debug RL software, working with hardware and memory limitations, as well as learning commonly used systems such as ROS and gazebo.

Currently I am working on my capstone project 'AI Air Hockey', focused on training a RL agent in sim then deploying the agent onto a real air hockey table. The table has a core-XY mechanism to allow the agent to move the mallet, as well as a camera to determine the position and velocity of the puck and opponents mallet.
